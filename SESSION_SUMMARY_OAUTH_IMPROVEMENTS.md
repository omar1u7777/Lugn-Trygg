# Session Summary - OAuth Health Integration - Complete Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**User Issue:** "Integrationssidan visar oriktiga data" + "Ingen data visas efter sync"  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED

---

## 🎯 Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Fake Data Showing
**User Reported:** "When I try to connect Google Health, it shows as connected with fake data, not real connection"

**Root Cause:** Frontend routed to legacy mock-data component instead of OAuth component

**Fixed:** ✅ Completed in previous session
- Changed `App.tsx` import to use `OAuthHealthIntegrations`
- Added debug logging to OAuth endpoints
- Marked legacy endpoints as deprecated

---

### Problem 2: No Data After Sync
**User Reported:** "Successfully connected but no data shows when I click Sync"

**Root Causes (Multiple):**
1. No explanation of **why** to connect health data
2. Frontend error handling didn't show empty data clearly
3. User unsure if data should be showing

**Fixed:** ✅ Completed this session

## 🔍 Why Data Might Be Empty

The troubleshooting guide explains all reasons:

1. **No data in Google Fit** (most common)
   - Device not synced
   - No activity recorded in 7 days
   - Need to sync phone first

2. **Device not connected**
   - Smartwatch/tracker not paired
   - Google Fit shows "No devices"

3. **Permissions not granted**
   - User didn't grant all scopes
   - Need to reconnect

4. **Token expired**
   - OAuth token has 1-hour expiry
   - Need to reconnect

5. **First sync takes time**
   - Google Fit API is slow (1-2 min normal)
   - Don't close browser during sync
